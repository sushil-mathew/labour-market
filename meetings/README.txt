As the project evolves we will update this folder, but I imagine it would have the following (which it doesn't have so far):
1. A folder for each of us to keep track of things we want to tell each other for next meeting.
2. A folder where we have some slides, document to present during the meeting. This might be excessive for you so you can not use it if you wish.
In my experience this has helped me and others keep track of my work so far. It also helps to not waste each others time - presentations can help us 
articulate what we want to say to each other. If we can make sense to each other, then we can make sense to others.
3. A folder where we keep some action points from our meeting or more like minutes of the meeting. This is useful and will come into use only if there are
some super big takeaways that were not discussed in our presentations/ppts.
