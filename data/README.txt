Description of each subfolder:
1. raw: contains all original source data that are directly downloaded from the web. 
	a. DO NOT save anything else here other than material downloaded from the web. 
	b. DO NOT edit any of these files unless there's a good reason to do so. Any edits should either go to one of the other folders.
	c. DO keep track of the links and citations where you get the data from and update the "citations and useful links" txt file within
	each data folder. This will be a life saver when we need quick references about tiny details wrt methodology etc.
	d. DO download all relevant documentation and put it here into the relevant folder.
	e. DO rename files so that it's easy to run code through, or we can quickly open a file if we need to do a quick check.
2. for_checks: all data to be used to do the quality checks are here
3. for_explor: all data for some quick explorations and summary statistics
3. final (subject to change): all data for explorations and final analyses/output should be stored here. This folder name may be changed as the project
evolves.
