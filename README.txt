The folder structure is as follows:
1. article: contains the files required to compile our report/blog. There's a README inside for further details.  
2. code: all code goes here. There's a README inside for further details.
3. data: all data goes here. There's a README inside for further details.
4. meetings: this is where we put things we want to discuss with each other prior to meetings and things we discuss during the meetings.
	More details in the README inside the folder.
5. notes: a folder to store rough notes made while either of us are working. 
6. output: all output such as figures, tables generated from the "code" folder goes here. See README inside the folder for further details. 
7. references, further reading: contains literature, references etc. that might be relevant. This folder is unorganised at the time of writing.
We need to figure something out. 
8. todo lists: this is where we put to-do lists. Helps organise tasks on a daily basis. Use or not as per your preference. 

If you change any of the files or structure within these subfolders or main folder in a way that goes against the README files or if the README files 
wouldn't give enough information about the changes you've made, please take a couple of minutes to update this file as necessary. It'll make life very easy
as we go along.
