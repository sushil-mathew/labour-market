DONE1. Download all ASHE (Annual Survey of Households and Earnings) data (2022 might be provisional) from ONS.
DONE2. Download all PAYE RTI (Pay as you Earn Real Time Information) data from ONS.
DONE3. List sources and links to methodology.
DONE4. Write python script to clean up all file names in the folder uniformly.
DONE5. Find out what time of the year ASHE is collected. PAYE is monthly. So we need to make ASHE and PAYE comparable. My feeling is that ASHE is 
conducted throughout the year.
DONE6. Find out what happens when workers are fired in ASHE data. If they need to be employed for >= 12 months to be included, 
then we should be taking a specific month in PAYE to make ASHE and PAYE comparable.
DONE7. Find out when someone would drop out of the PAYE dataset. This is important for the report.
DONE8. Ideally both data sources should aggregate in the same way plus minus the effect of unemployment rate. Within a year employment drops by 2% (at most)
compared to highest level. See if it does that for 
	DONE(a) Mean and median gross annual wages
	DONE(b) Number employed for each age group. 
	DONE(c) Gross daily wage
9. For really young people and really old people, summarize shares in age groups. See how much the mean wages shift by, if I drop really young
and/or really old individuals. 
10. Do some summary stats and visualisations for call with Mansi. Some key variables are 
	(a) shares by occupation, industry, age, sex.
	(b) mean and median hours worked 
	(c) mean and median wages
