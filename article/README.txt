At the time of writing this, Sushil envisions this folder to contain all the rough drafts or stages of writing. 
For ex: Draft 1, could be rough notes on the language, audience, length etc.
Draft 2, could be some super rough results in a very rough notes kind of form. 
Draft 3, could have some rough images
Draft 4, could have some equations, etc.

It doesn't need to follow this structure. But let's see where it goes.
